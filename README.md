# JIIT Navigator

We developed a WearOS application using Flutter, which let's the user see different point of interests in the campus and their current location. It allows the user to be more efficient and navigate with ease around the campus.

We used Google Cloud Platform, Google Map styling wizard, Lottie animations for the project.
